 On a Tranquil Day
The ventiation vane
Atop the building across the street
Spinning so fast, says to me,
I cannot keep up with Mother Earth;
The speed of her turning is so great.
But she carries
Her cradle of life
So carefully, so mildly
That in it she gives you
A life of peace.
During your time upon her bosom
Can you not give her
A word of thanks ?
For a great gift received
Is often forgotten as if
Never received at all.
